I finally took some time out this weekend to create a new blog. I was initially using [octopress](http://octopress.org/) but it had way more features than I needed. I decided to go with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a simple static site generator.

I created the layout/theme from scratch and chose some vibrant colors. I'm experiment with colors that I don't use often. I do like the yellow and black combo and will probably stick with it, for now.

And before you ask, yes! It is responsive! I only needed one breakpoint to get the nav to cooperate.

There are a few other subtle CSS3 effects, if you haven't already noticed, there's a `border-radius: 0 0 100% 100%;` on the header as seen in the screen shot below.

That gives it a nice curved look on the bottom. If a browser doesn't support the `border-radius` property, it gracefully degrades, as seen in the image below.

I was debating over which font to use for the name, It was a close call between [Lobster](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lobster) and [Kaushan Script](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Kaushan+Script). I ended up picking the latter.

There's a lot more I would like to add to the blog but figured incrementally adding features as I go, would be the best approach.
